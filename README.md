## Exploring the Evolution of Lego

This project is based on a DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com/projects/10) project that involves analyzing a dataset of Lego sets released between 1950 and 2017. The main objective of this project was to answer several questions about the history of Lego, including:

* What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?
* In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme in terms of the number of sets released that year?
* How many unique sets were released each year between 1950 and 2017?
